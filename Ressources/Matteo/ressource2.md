# An Architecture Overview for AI in Racing Games

## Introduction

This article explores the architecture and design strategies for artificial intelligence in high-speed racing games. While the focus is on simulation-style games with realistic physics, many principles also apply to arcade racing games. The ultimate goal is to create AI drivers that are as skilled and reactive as human players, which requires attention to detail and a deep understanding of driving physics.

## Understanding the Physics

Effective racing AI depends on how accurately it models the game's physical environment.

- In simple racing games, the AI can follow predefined paths and use basic rules for braking and acceleration.
- In realistic simulations, the AI must manage complex vehicle dynamics, including:
  - Engine torque
  - Tire grip
  - Braking systems
  - Transmission behavior

Tires are central to the vehicle's behavior. Every acceleration, turn, or braking maneuver depends on maintaining grip. The AI must operate just below the grip limit to maximize performance while avoiding skidding or loss of control.

## The Architecture

The AI system is organized into four distinct layers:

- **Character / Persona Layer**  
  Manages individual driver profiles and skill levels over long timescales.

- **Strategic Layer**  
  Sets high-level goals based on the track and race context (e.g., speed plan, racing line).

- **Tactical Layer**  
  Converts strategy into frame-by-frame decisions (e.g., overtake, defend, recover).

- **Control Layer**  
  Executes low-level inputs (steering, throttle, brake) in real time.

A **collision avoidance subsystem** runs across all layers. It handles long-range planning and immediate reactions to avoid obstacles or other cars.

## The AI Driver Persona

Each AI driver is given a unique persona with several adjustable characteristics:

- **Skill** – Affects ability to drive near the grip limit.
- **Aggression** – Determines how assertively the AI overtakes or defends.
- **Control** – Governs throttle smoothness and braking precision.
- **Mistake Rate** – Introduces variability through occasional errors.

To make drivers feel more human, **biorhythms** (e.g., sine wave patterns) vary the skill level over time, producing temporary strengths and weaknesses.

## Racing Behaviors

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is used to switch between racing behaviors. Each behavior is scored based on utility, and hysteresis prevents constant switching.

Key behaviors include:

- **Normal Driving**  
  Follows optimal racing line, maintains speed and spacing.

- **Overtake**  
  Identifies passing opportunities and increases risk-taking temporarily.

- **Defend and Block**  
  Tries to prevent being overtaken by blocking or positioning.

- **Branch**  
  Chooses between route options or pit stops.

- **Recover**  
  Reacts to off-track or spin events by regaining control and rejoining safely.

## The Race Choreographer

A scripting system allows designers to inject custom behavior mid-race. It can:

- Modify driver skill
- Trigger mechanical failures
- Force aggressive or passive actions

This tool enables narrative control and tailored player experiences.

## Interfaces

AI shares the same interface as human players:

- Reads inputs from the physics engine (e.g., grip, velocity).
- Sends control inputs through standard interfaces.
- May share **intentions** (e.g., planned overtakes) with other AI cars to simulate driver intuition.  
  Random variation ensures AI isn’t too perfect.

## Balancing the AI

Balancing creates fair, engaging experiences. Methods include:

- **Rubber-banding**  
  Dynamically adjusts speed or grip to keep races competitive.

- **Physics Tweaks**  
  Slight modifications to car handling per AI skill level.

- **Offline Tuning**  
  Manual or scripted adjustments for different tracks or races.

## Offline Automated Learning

AI performance can be enhanced using **genetic algorithms** or other optimization methods:

- Learn the best racing line and control profiles.
- Evaluate performance based on lap time, tire wear, or stability.
- Use batch testing to evolve improved parameters.

Manual overrides remain essential when game rules or track layouts change.

## Conclusion

Designing strong racing AI requires balancing real-time reactivity and offline design work. Each architectural layer, from persona to control, builds toward a believable opponent.

By combining:

- Realistic physics
- Multi-layered behaviors
- Personalized AI driver profiles

...developers can craft racing AIs that provide immersive and challenging gameplay.
