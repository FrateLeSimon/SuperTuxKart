# Image-Based Video Game Asset Generation and Evaluation Using Deep Learning: A Systematic Review

This paper presents a systematic review of deep learning techniques applied to the generation and evaluation of image-based assets in video games. Covering 99 peer-reviewed publications between 2016 and 2023, the study offers a structured analysis of methods, trends, targeted asset types, and evaluation strategies in this emerging research domain.

The review identifies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as the predominant model used throughout the period, with a rising shift toward Diffusion Models (DMs) in recent years. Applications span a wide spectrum of asset categories, including 2D and 3D textures, level and map generation, character and facial modeling, font and typography synthesis, and style transfer. More niche topics, such as logo and user interface (UI) generation, remain underexplored.

To assess the quality of generated assets, the review classifies evaluation approaches into three groups: (1) objective metrics such as FID, IS, and PSNR; (2) perceptual metrics like CLIP Score and SSIM; and (3) human-centered evaluations, including user studies and expert reviews. Despite the wide use of quantitative methods, the authors emphasize the importance of qualitative and perceptual feedback, especially for assets intended for interactive and visual consumption.

The study also notes several limitations in the current literature: the lack of standardized datasets, inconsistent evaluation protocols, and limited attention to ethical concerns related to dataset sourcing and copyright. The authors advocate for improved reproducibility, better benchmarks, and the inclusion of human-centric design principles.

In conclusion, this review highlights the growing role of deep generative models in automating and enriching the asset creation pipeline for video games. It provides a roadmap for future work, encouraging more diverse applications, standardized evaluation frameworks, and ethically responsible practices in the use of AI-driven game asset generation.
